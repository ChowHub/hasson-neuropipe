18-35 year old subjects with normal or corrected-to-normal vision participated
in an fMRI experiment to investigate interactions between long-term and working 
memory. They lay in a Skyra 3T scanner with a mirror on the head coil reflecting
projected stimuli. TR length was 1.5s. Eyetracking data were also collected.

Task 1: TZ Movie
The scan begins with a short eyetrack calibration; subjects fixate on 5 dots in 
sequence (3s per dot). They then watch a 25-minute movie (The Twilight Zone).
One group of subjects views the entire TZ movie. Another group of subjects viewed
the first part (10 minutes) of the movie the previous day, and now views 10
minutes of a different movie concatenated with the last 15 minutes of the
TZ movie. Another group of subjects views the same concatenated movie, but did
not view any movie the day before (ie they never see part 1 of the TZ movie).
The scan is 1030 TRs.

Task 2: Pieman audio story
Subjects listen to a 7-minute spoken story (Pieman) four times (four separate
scans). For two scans the story is intact, and for two scans the story is
temporally scrambled. The order of conditions is intact, scramble, intact, scramble.
